      <h1 class="display-3">Logi-Kart</h1>
      <p>LogiCart Pvt Ltd. is an Indian electronic commerce company based in New Delhi, India. Founded by Sumit
        Kumar and Mayank singh in 2020, the company initially focused on Video games, before expanding into other
        product categories such as Selling gaming components, Consoles and much more.

        The service competes primarily with Amazon' s Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] as of
        March 2020, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[7] Flipkart is significantly
        dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com),
        and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics .[8] Flipkart
        also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

        In August 2018, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in Flipkart for US$16 billion,
        valuing it at $22 billion.</p>
